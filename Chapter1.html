        <h2>Vocabulary (ad verbatim)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Physics - Physics, which from the Greek <span style="font-style:italic">ph√∫sis</span>, meaning "nature", is concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon.</li>
            <li>Order of Magnitude - the order of magnitude of a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it.</li>
            <li>Model - a model is a representation of something that is often to difficult (or impossible) to display directly.</li>
            <li>Theory - a theory is a testable explanation for patterns in nature supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers.</li>
            <li>Law - a Law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments.</li>
        </ul>
